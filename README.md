Project 1:

1. I have choosen project 1 as it has more interesting stuffs to do like animation and zoomable.
2. I have used thunk middleware to do async fetching of the API given.
3. Since the data is huge to load, I have used endReached prop to load the data on scroll so the memory usage will be less and thus will improve the performance.
4. I have used pure component for the renderItem component for performance optimization.
5. For the modal slide up animation I have used the react-navigation modal to give a smoother and fine animation. Also, the zoom image function is smoother to animate when it is in a seperate component and used Animated api for it.
